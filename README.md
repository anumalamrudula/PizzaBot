# PizzaBot
 
Chatbots are now commonplace and are helping businesses with repetitive tasks such as taking orders or answering frequently asked questions. For a business selling product or service, we often need to take orders or schedule appointments.


As a sample, I have developed a pizza chatbot that is able to take pizza orders for a store. This chatbot will be able to take an order for a pizza, getting information such as the size of the pizza, associated toppings and type of crust, and it will also ask for an order confirmation and will get some basic contact information from the customer making the order.


    Chatbot is configured using Google Dialogflow which translates natural language into machine readable data using machine learning models that are trained by provided examples.
    Dialogflow agent contains intents which help to respond to user's requests.
    Entities (intent parameter types) are used to dictate how data from a user expression is extracted.
    Contexts are used to understand the flow of a conversation
    Fulfillment (makes conversational experiences and Dialogflow dynamic) are used to execute backend logic and makes calls of the APIs and services behind the scenes to retrieve information that can be used to help the user or making updates.
